# What is quicksend?

[Quicksend](https://github.com/dangarbri/quicksend) is a command line
utility for transferring files between computers connected to a local
network. It is an alternative to setting up things like an ssh daemon,
ftp server, samba share, etc, when you just want a simple file
transfer. No configuration is necessary.

# Why does this exist?

I wrote quicksend because I find it a pain to use cloud servers for
moving files between PC’s on my local network. I don’t have much media
on my computers, so I don’t have a big need for setting up a network
file share between them. An NFS like samba is a fine solution, but in
that moment where I wanted to send a file and not have to configure a
samba share, I couldn’t find anything. And if you don't have a local
NFS, your only other options are dropbox and friends or emailing
yourself. All of these are way more work when I just want to copy a
file.

I did complain a bit on a forum and got some feedback that I was being
lazy, well yes, I was being lazy. Computers are supposed to make these
kinds of things easy! The whole point is to limit the work, but it’s
also true that many programs come out of “lazy programmers” and
quicksend is another example of it.

Right now it requires being compiled manually, but soon I’ll create
pre-built binaries and attach them to the release.
