description: An SDL2 based drawing library
type: Library

[Mini Draw](https://github.com/dangarbri/mini-draw/) is a graphics library I'm working on for
creating graphical applications based on SDL2!

The library provides interfaces for dealing with the
more tedious aspects of SDL2 like opening a window,
loading textures, loading fonts, and animating objects
on-screen.

The library uses the GNU Build System which also comes
with the best unit test framework I've ever used.
